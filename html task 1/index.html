            <p>
              A full-stack web application built with Django and styled with
              Tailwind CSS that enables users to browse books, view detailed
              information, and submit reviews. Registered users can rate books
              from 1 to 5 stars and leave comments, while administrators can
              manage book entries (title, author, category, cover image,
              description) via the Django admin panel. Features include search
              by title/author, category filtering, pagination (6 books per page
              in a responsive grid layout), average ratings display, responsive
              design, and image uploads.

            <p>
              DFAP is a unified mobile and web-based platform designed to
              empower fishermen and fish-farmers by integrating marketplace
              functionality, IoT-driven water-quality monitoring, weather and
              flood alert systems, and AI-powered aquaculture support. The
              system enables users to buy/sell fish and supplies, monitor pond
              conditions in real time, receive early warnings for adverse
              weather events, and leverage data-driven insights to optimise
              production and sustainability.

            <h3>Luna — Voice Assistant</h3>
            <p>
              Luna is a Python-based voice assistant designed to interact with
              users via speech recognition (using the Vosk model), respond to
              commands, and manage a music library by playing YouTube audio
              tracks. The system integrates modules for voice input, command
              parsing, music lookup and playback, supporting a natural-language
              interface to control your media experience.

          <h3>
            A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Accurate Detection and
            Classification of On-Road Vehicles Using Improved YOLOv11
          </h3>
          <p>
            Vehicle detection and classification systems have significantly
            improved in recent years due to the developments in
            deep-learning-based frameworks for object detection. These systems
            have various applications in autonomous driving, intelligent
            transportation, traffic management, and urban planning. We propose a
            framework for accurately detecting and classifying on-road vehicles
            using a deep learning model called You Only Look Once (YOLOv11). Our
            study provides a comprehensive knowledge of model efficiency in
            vehicle detection and classification across nine classes: bicycle,
            bus, car, e-bike, jeep, motorcycle, tricycle, truck, and van. We
            tested the performance of the proposed improved YOLOv11 model and
            evaluated it using four performance matrices. The proposed improved
            YOLOv11 model achieved a precision of 96.5% and a recall of 96%, an
            F1 score of 77%, and an AUPRC of 82%. We also compared the proposed
            model performance with other versions of the YOLO series, as well as
            various traditional deep learning models to determine the
            effectiveness in vehicle detection and classification. The framework
            is a strong option for real-time traffic monitoring and autonomous
            driving applications, as the results show that it greatly increases
            precision and recall, especially in high-traffic situations.
